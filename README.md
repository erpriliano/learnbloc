## Bloc State Management + API 

```
Why Bloc? 
Bloc makes it easy to separate presentation from business logic, making your code fast, easy to test and reusable.
```

This repo is created by me to learn more about state manegement in flutter using Bloc so I made this simple app that is built using Bloc state management and API called from TMDB site.

You can check my code reference from this [site](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/flutterinfinitelisttutorial).
